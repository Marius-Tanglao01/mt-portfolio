                  <p>
                    I'm a Calgary-based designer who treats design like oxygen;
                    it's not a career I clock into, it's my way of life. With 3
                    years of experience in brand and graphic design, I push
                    brands into bold, unexpected territory where they actually
                    stand out.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Unlike the "trendy" one-style-fits-all designers flooding
                    Instagram, I don't box myself in. Sticking to one look is
                    boring, and brands deserve more than a "style". I can build
                    something premium, clean, and modern one day, then craft a
                    brand identity that feels like it belongs on the cover of a
                    black metal record the next. My versatility is the point:
                    design should serve the brand, not my personal aesthetic.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    My work is built on high standards and an obsession with
                    details most people overlook, because a brand doesn't just
                    need to look good, it needs to feel right. Having majored in
                    Graphic Design at the Southern Alberta Institute of
                    Technology, I bring precision, strategy, and a refusal to
                    settle into mediocrity in every project. Safe design is
                    forgettable design. And forgettable isn't an option in this
                    industry; it's a crime.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Outside of visual design I love working out in the gym,
                    listening to metal, doing mountain hikes, designing Geometry
                    Dash levels, learning about Dinosaurs/paleontology, and
                    diving deep into dark internet rabbit holes (waiting for the
                    OG JTK image🤞).

            <div class="faq-list">
              <details>
                <summary><h2>What do you specialize in?</h2></summary>
                <p>
                  To be completely honest, I do not specialize in anything when
                  it comes to graphic design. I am too curious, too obsessive,
                  and too ambitious; I cannot just focus on one thing I thrive
                  in aspects like brand identity design, advertisement design,
                  and social media design, but I do not really stick to them.
                  Today I could be doing a social media ad for a B2B company,
                  and the next day I could be designing a logo for an
                  underground black metal band. A TikTok influencer might say,
                  “uuuh, you should niche down because a master of all is a
                  master of none,” but I completely disagree. Graphic design
                  isn’t just about specializing; it’s about adapting,
                  experimenting, and finding innovative solutions.
                </p>

              <details>
                <summary><h2>What software do you use?</h2></summary>
                <p>
                  I use the usual Adobe Big 3 which is Photoshop, Illustrator,
                  and InDesign. I use Figma for UI design and presentation
                  design (seriously Figma Slides is OP). I use Premier Pro for
                  occasional video editing. I also like using Canva even though
                  designers hate it but I think it is a wonderful tool to get
                  your friends into graphic design. When I’m designing with
                  Illustrator, I do it alone, but when I design with Canva, I
                  have fun with the normies.

                <p>
                  YES! If you are a potential employer looking for a graphic
                  designer to be part of a design studio I am ready to get in an
                  interview. I will only entertain Calgary-based employers.

                  I built this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I
                  do find coding interesting and exciting, it is not my focus. I
