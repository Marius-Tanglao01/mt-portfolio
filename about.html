            <div class="Paragraph">
              <p>
                I am a self-proclaimed graphic design addict residing in the
                middle of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Obsessive, blunt, and
                adaptive—that’s how I approach all things design. With three
                years of experience as both a freelance and in-house graphic
                designer, I’ve developed strong skills in typography and brand
                design. I believe typography is the hardest aspect of graphic
                design to master, but it’s also my favorite because I’m
                absolutely addicted to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                I thrive in collaborative environments, working closely with
                creative directors and other designers to bring projects from
                moodboards to final execution, whether it’s crafting marketing
                materials or developing comprehensive brand guidelines. Feedback
                and critique are invaluable to me—I genuinely enjoy hearing
                different perspectives (or just people roasting me) after
                completing a project. It’s where growth happens.
              </p>

              <p>
                Currently, I’m studying Interactive Design, majoring in Graphic
                Design, at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. I
                believe that a designer fueled by delusion and addiction will
                always surpass one driven by creativity alone. AS LONG AS THERE
                IS DELUSION, THERE IS HOPE. EMBRACE THE HUSTLE AND GRIND IN
                DESIGN.

              <h2>General Graphic Design</h2>
              <p>
                Graphic design is the art of combining images, text, and colors
                to communicate ideas visually. It's used in everyday things like
                posters, advertisements, and social media content to catch
                people's attention and deliver a message.

              <h2>Advertisement/Marketing Design</h2>
              <p>
                Advertisement and marketing design is all about creating visuals
                that grab attention and promote products, services, or ideas.

              <h2>Brand Identity/Logo Design</h2>
              <p>
                Brand identity and logo design focus on creating a visual
                representation of a brand that makes it recognizable and
                memorable. It involves designing logos, color schemes,
                typography, and other visual elements that reflect a company's
                personality, values, and goals.

              <p>
                To be completely honest, I do not specialize in anything when it
                comes to graphic design. I am too curious, too obsessive, and
                too ambitious; I cannot just focus on one thing. I thrive in
                aspects like brand identity design, advertisement design, and
                social media design, but I do not really stick to them. Today I
                could be doing a social media ad for a B2B company, and the next
                day I could be designing a logo for an underground black metal
                band. A TikTok influencer might say, “uuuh, you should niche
                down because a master of all is a master of none,” but I
                completely disagree. Graphic design isn’t just about
                specializing; it’s about adapting, experimenting, and finding
                innovative solutions.

            <summary><h2>Why are you a designer?</h2></summary>
            <p>
              I am a graphic designer because it is not just what I do—it is who
              I am. I am a graphic design addict because I center my life around
              it. I think about graphic design 70% of the time. My Instagram and
              X algorithms are filled with graphic design content, my YouTube
              homepage is all about graphic design, and my future kids might
              even be named after something related to graphic design. From the
              moment I first opened Photoshop, I was like an anime character
              isekaied into another world. I choose never to retire as a graphic
              designer; I will design until the day I die. If Playboi Carti is
              MUSIC then I AM GRAPHIC DESIGN.

                    My all-time favorite musician is Playboi Carti. He is the
                    reason why I respect music itself. Carti is a generational
                    musician and he can be compared to the likes of Beethoven,
                    Mozart, and Michael Jackson. His album, Whole Lotta Red made
                    me realize that music is an art form that can sometimes have
                    an impact on human emotions. I love Playboi Carti so much
                    that I named some of this website's CSS classes in his name.
                    I will forever be a Playboi Carti glazer because he is the
                    best rapper in the world. Other rappers I glaze are Ken
                    Carson, Kanye West, and Sematary. Besides rap, I love black
                    metal music. My favorite black metal bands are Anaal
                    Nathrakh, Mayhem, KFR, Darkthrone, Burzum, Tryglav, and
                    Deathspell Omega.

                    My favorite kinds of movies involve giant kaiju or
                    dinosaurs. I am a huge fan of Godzilla movies, particularly
                    Godzilla (1954) and Godzilla: Final Wars (2004). I also
                    enjoy the newer MonsterVerse Godzilla films and Godzilla
                    Minus One (2023). As for horror movies, I am quite fond of
                    the gory Saw series, with Saw III (2006) being my favorite.
                    The iconic "Hello Zepp" theme always gives me chills. I
                    watch all sorts of movies, from groundbreaking epics like
                    The Lord of the Rings (2001–2003) to emotional
                    rollercoasters like The Green Mile (1999).

                    <h2>What are your favorite anime series?</h2>

                  <p>
                    I haven’t watched a single anime series in 2024. Why?
                    Because of Attack on Titan—my all-time favorite anime
                    series, and possibly my all-time favorite TV show. When the
                    show ended, it was so incredible that I decided to stop
                    watching anime altogether. Attack on Titan is a generational
                    masterpiece, and only a few series have matched its level of
                    hype. Other anime series I love include GTO, Death Note,
                    Neon Genesis Evangelion, Kill la Kill, One Punch Man, JoJo's
                    Bizarre Adventure, Hunter x Hunter, and Code Geass.
